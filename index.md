## About Me
I am currently a junior in Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, Yao Class) at Tsinghua University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to this, I was a member of the Chinese national team for the Asian Physics Olympiad. I maintain a GPA rank of first 3% and am advised by Prof. Li Yi at Tsinghua University.

Currently, I am serving as a student intern in Lecar Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by Prof. Guanya Shi. My primary research interests include physics-based motion synthesis and robot learning.

Apart from studying and conducting research, I love life and have taken on the roles of master of ceremonies and student representative speaker multiple times at university. I have also undertaken the social work responsibility of class monitor. My hobbies include singing, public speaking, fitness, and music.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** physics-based motion synthesis, interaction-centered motion synthesis, vision-languge model, motion structure
- **Robot Learning:** robot control, reinforcement learning
