## About Me
I am currently a senior in [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to this, I was a member of the Chinese national team for the <span style="color:darkred"><strong>Asian Physics Olympiad</strong></span>. 

In terms of academic performance, my average GPA is 3.98, <span style="color:darkred"><strong>ranking first in my class(1/94)</strong></span>. I began my research under the supervision of Prof. [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/) , focusing on character animation and robot learning. During the Spring and Summer of 2025, I was a student intern at [LeCAR Lab](https://lecar-lab.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/), where I worked on humanoid research. I also had the pleasure of collaborating with [Zhengyi(Zen) Luo](https://www.zhengyiluo.com/) and the Meta FAIR team. **My primary research goal is to leverage large-scale human data to build generalizable robots capable of performing the full spectrum of human skills.**

Beyond academics and research, I am **outgoing and curious, always eager to meet interesting people😊 and through them discover new perspectives** on the world around me🌟. I have often taken the stage as a host, performer, and student representative speaker 🎤🎭 at major university events, and have served as class monitor and seminar organizer, supporting and connecting with my peers 🙋‍♀️. In my free time, I love writing (mostly essays✍️), singing 🎶, dancing 💃, keeping fit 🏋️, and traveling ✈️ — all of which inspire me, shape my confidence, and deepen my appreciation for the beauty of life.

I am currently **seeking a PhD position for Fall 2026** and would love the opportunity to connect and exchange ideas with researchers and peers.
